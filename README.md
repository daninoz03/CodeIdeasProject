## Main Areas of Code

### Udemy
Most of the code added in this repo is from the the `Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers` Udemy course.
They are found under the following directory:
```$xslt
src/main/java/UdemyJavaCourse
```

### Java Functionality testing
I have added packages for testing various java functionality (i.e. streams, reflection etc)

### Unit tests
Unit tests are found under the standard java testing directory:
```$xslt
src/test/java
```

### Travis CI
There is a `travis.yml` file included which is used to run all unit tests when pushing to github. Merging will not be allowed if any test fails.
